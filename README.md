## Details
Android Mobile Application where a user can put their pet up for adoption or adopt a pet. 

## Features

Features include:
* Creating an online profile for the pet to be adopted
* Search through a list of potential pets by area code
* Contacting other users to inquire about their potential pet

## Reason
We created this app to help pets find a new home. The occupancy in animal shelters has increased and this
app would be ideal for shelters to show off their animals.
