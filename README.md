# ![app icon](./.github/readme-images/app_icon.) PetMobile

## Details
Android Mobile Application where a user can put their pet up for adoption or adopt a pet. 

## Features

Features include:
* Creating an online profile for the pet to be adopted
* Search through a list of potential pets by area code
* Contacting other users to inquire about their potential pet

## Reason
We created this app to help pets find a new home. This app would help pet owners who can no longer keep a pet or even animal shelters. Since the occupancy in animal shelters has increased this app would be ideal for shelters to show off their animals to potential new homes.
