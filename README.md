## Details
Android Mobile Application where a user can put their pet up for adoption or adopt a pet. 

## Features

Features include:
* Creating an online profile for the pet to be adopted
* Search through a list of potential pets by area code
* Contacting other users to inquire about their potential pet

## Reason
We created this app to help pets find a new home. The occupancy in animal shelters has increased and this
app would be ideal for shelters to show off their animals. 

## Home Page

Here a user may enter their zipcode and tap Adopt to find animals for adoption in their area.

A user may also tap Re-Home to create a profile for their pet to be adopted.

## Profile

Here a user may take a photo of their animal by tapping Take Photo.

A user may:
* Enter their Pet's Name
* Use the dropdown menu to select their Pet's Type
* Enter their Email
* Enter their Phone Number
* Enter their ZIPCode

If a user fails to enter a Pet Name and ZIPCode this will result in an error.

Once a user taps submit they will be prompted back to the Home Page.
